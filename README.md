# machine-learning

Machine learning is a mathematical optimization routine which trains algorithms so that they have the ability to make predictions.

### Linear Regression

[Honey Production](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Linear-Regression-scikit-learn.ipynb) takes current production trends in beekeeping, and predicts future honey output.

### Multiple Linear Regression

[Rental Prices](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Multiple-Linear-Regression-scikit-learn.ipynb) performs miltivariable calculus to predict rental prices for apartments in New York City with 82% accuracy.

### Logistic Regression

[Natural Disaster](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Logistic-Regression-scikit-learn.ipynb) isolates important features related to a natural disaster to predict that a middle class man in his 20s had only a 10% chance of surviving the Titanic.

### Naive Bayes

[Text Classifier](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Naive-Bayes-scikit-learn.ipynb) is a naive bayes classifier that determines the subject of an email using its word content with 99% accuracy. 

### K-Nearest Neighbors

[MRI Scans](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/K-Nearest-Neighbors-scikit-learn.ipynb) is a project I coded using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which interpreted MRI scans to isolate and classify cancerous tumours with 96% accuracy.

### Decision Tree

[National Flag](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Decision-Tree-scikit-learn.ipynb) interprets feature data of a nation's flag, and with 55% accuracy predicts which continent that nation is located.

### Random Forest

[Income Predictor](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Random-Forest-scikit-learn.ipynb) is a random forest algorithm that predicts which Americans make over $50,000 year with 82% accuracy.

### Perceptron

[AND Gate](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/Perceptron-scikit-learn.ipynb) is a perceptron I developed which isolates the decision boundary inside a truth table to function as an AND logic gate.

### KMeans Clustering

[Digits](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/KMeans-Clustering-scikit-learn.ipynb) interpreted my hand written numerical input and named the digits with varying accuracy.

[Iris](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/KMeans-Clustering-Iris-scikit-learn.ipynb) classifies subspecies of flora using only their dimensions with 92% accuracy.

# deep-learning

[Digits](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/deep-learning/deep_learning_MNIST.ipynb) is a deep learning model I developed with Keras and TensorFlow, which classifies numerical integers 0 - 10 with 97% accuracy.

[Cats and Dogs](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning/blob/master/deep-learning/Cats-and-Dogs-OpenCV.ipynb) is a computer vision model built with OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow, which classifies cats and dogs with 77% accuracy.
